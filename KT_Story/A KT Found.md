## A KT Found
Misty walks up the stairs to the second floor apartment. She is earlier than normal; Katelynn wanted help with a new hairstyle before their shift at the *Hot Crossed Bun*. 

Misty knocks on the door. 

_Silence_

Maybe Katelyn had the stereo on.

She knocks again.

_Silence_ 

She wouldn't have left already...

Could she still be in bed?

Misty tries the knob. 

Locked. 

Where did Katelyn say she hid the spare key?

The light by the fire extinguisher, I think.
