## A KT Comes to Town
Carrying two bags she steps off the Greyhound bus in Laslow, a sleepy little farm community in the Pacific Northwest. The small town serves as both home to a major research university, and a thriving inland sea port.

Katelynn Trimble came to Laslow because her dad grew up here and talked about the town all the time. 

For as much as he talked about Laslow though they had never travelled there. Any family she had there were dead or too distantly related to bother over a homeless girl looking for her place in the world.

Katelynn’s first order of business is finding some coffee. The bus ride made her feel tired and made her mouth feel dry. 

After that she could think about finding some food, maybe some work, and possibly a place to stay.

As she walks toward the bus station she notices a couple of employees standing near the side of the building and smoking. Katelynn walks straight up to them and asks “Can I bum a smoke?”

The station workers look at each other and one pulls out a pack with a lighter stuck in it and hands it to Katelynn.

She pulls out the lighter and taps the bottom of the pack against the heel of her hand. Then she shakes out one of the cigarettes and puts the pack on top of one of her bags.
