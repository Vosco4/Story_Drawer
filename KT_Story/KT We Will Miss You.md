# KT We Will Miss You
## The Message
The _Hot Crossed Bun_ is not the same after April 17, 20---. The sign, outside of the shop, displays a message on that day.

*4/17/20--
KT
We Will Miss You.* \</center\>

No other message.  

The newcomers that visit the shop after that date don’t know any difference. The shop is cheerful and makes tasty pastries and other baked goods.

But the regulars know there is something missing. That everyone at the shop is missing a little piece of their happiness.

An extra brightness has left the shop, forever.
