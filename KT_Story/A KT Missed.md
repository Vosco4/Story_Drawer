## A KT Missed
5:27 AM.  

Rain or shine he rises and walks the 2.8 miles from his one-bedroom ground floor apartment to the _Hot Crossed Bun_.   

He says he goes there for a coffee, a fresh pastry, and to read the newspaper.   

The real reason is to socialize and have some human interaction in his day.  

William "Bill" Grannel is a man of habits.   

It is the same on April 17th as on any other recent day, but things weren't always this way.  

The *Hot Crossed Bun* is a local secret, that everyone knows. The regulars are there every day, but new people still find their way. Whether directed to try this or that or stumbling upon the shop in their wanderings.   

 The tiny pastry shop, set back from the road, is easy to miss, but being across the street from the park keeps up the foot traffic.   
  

Fresh coffee and tea all-day and numerous fresh-baked treats throughout the day keeps the locals happy and the visitors hoping to return soon.  
 Making the _Bun_  an enjoyable place to hang out and visit.
Bill enters through the back entrance of the shop. He says it's because every Tom, Harry, and Angela uses the park side entrance. But he likes to poke his head into the manager's office and say hi to Felicia.  

This day is no different.  

"Good morning, Felicia, love."  

"Good morning, Bill." She looks over her glasses at him. "You know we have a front door, right."   

"Yeah,  a' course. But then I wouldn't get-ta-see yur lovely face ta' start my day."  

Her eyes crinkle with her smile. "You old charmer. There are fresh scones this morning. And Noah was announcing fresh coffee a few minutes ago."  

"Thanks, dear, sounds grand." He taps his knuckles on the door jamb. "Ya' have a good mornin'. And try ta' come out and take a visit break."  

"Sure thing, Bill," Felicia says, with her eyes down on her papers, back to work.  

Bill walks down the hall past the small service kitchen, he raises a hand to Yanel, as she preps a batch of lemon bars for later.  

As he rounds the corner out into the main cafe area, a shout greets him.  

"Good mornin' _Billy Goat_."  

"Good mornin', to ya Noah. What 'id I tell ya' 'bout yelling at an old man, when he comes into a room."  

Noah gets a sheepish grin. But Bill erupts in a roar of laughter and waves away the apologies.   

"Felicia says there're scones and coffee out here."  

Noah raises his eyebrows and looks around. "What do you think we're running here? Some-kind-a pastry shop?"   

Holding up his hands, William puts on his best confused old man act. "Sorry, I must've taken a wrong turn. I guess I'll make do with a convenience store danish and some gas station coffee."  

Noah lets out a fake scream. "Uncle, uncle...   
You win. I can't let an innocent old man go to such a cruel fate."   

He offers Bill a plate and a mug. Both are still steaming.  

"Ya' know Noah if I didn't think it would give you a big head I'd tell you that you're a damn fine barista."  

"Billy Goat, if I didn't think you would die of shock, I'd tell you thanks."  

The morning goes on. Noah keeps Bill's coffee fresh and brings a few more scones. "Pass on my compliments to Yanel."  

Bill reads his way through the paper. The President made some damn fool remarks again. A comic book movie came out over the weekend, and supposedly so did one of its main actors.   

Bill isn't one to long for the *old days* instead, he is amazed at the progress of humanity.  

In areas of knowledge, scientific discovery, and culture, our species has come so far from our hunter-gatherer past. But he also knows that the world is full of greedy, selfish nit-wits, who want to take care of themselves, and damn-the-rest.   

Bill tends to live and let live, but some days the thought of rounding some of the bastards up and throwing them in prison makes him smile.  

Bill loves the *Hot Crossed Bun* as much as any person can love a place. He cannot imagine his morning without it anymore. Though it had not been so that long ago.  

Even when the tourists find their way to the little bakery, he still enjoys it.  

Bill's love of the *Hot Crossed Bun* is all because of Katelynn Trimble.
